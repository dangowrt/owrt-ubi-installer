This script downloads the OpenWrt ImageBuilder to generate a release-like (i.e. LuCI included) *sysupgrade* image. The process involves re-packaging the *initramfs* image to contain everything necessary for a permanent recovery image within the NAND flash, including the installer script and the prerequisite installation images.

**WARNING #1** This will replace the bootloader (TF-A 2.4, U-Boot 2021.10) and convert the flash layout of the device to [UBI](https://github.com/dangowrt/linksys-e8450-openwrt-installer/issues/9). The installer stores a copy of the previous bootchain in a dedicated UBI volume `boot_backup`.

**WARNING #2** Re-flashing the installer when the device is already using UBI flash layout will erase the previously backed up bootchain, which in most cases would be the vendor/official one.

It's recommended that you make a **complete backup** of the device flash __**before**__ running the installer. (see below "[Device flash backup procedure while running the stock firmware version 1.0](#device-flash-backup-procedure-while-running-the-stock-firmware-version-10)")

You'll need the below to use the script to generate the installer image:
* All [prerequisites of the OpenWrt ImageBuilder](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/imagebuilder#prerequisites) 
* `libfdt-dev`
* `cmake`

If you are not interested in building yourself, the pre-built files are available [here](https://github.com/dangowrt/linksys-e8450-openwrt-installer/releases).

## Downgrade firmware

#### Upstream firmware version 1.1 and newer rejects the installer image. As a temporary workaround, please downgrade to version 1.0 before running the installer.

## Device flash backup procedure while running the stock firmware version 1.0

1. Flash `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-initramfs-recovery.itb` (note that this file doesn't have the word _installer_ in its filename)
2. Login [http://192.168.1.1](http://192.168.1.1/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/flash), then navigate to **System -> Backup / Flash Firmware** and save a copy of each of the `mtdblock`.
3. Now we are going to make a **complete backup** of the device (**includes original/vendor firmware**), connect to the device via SSH and enter the following commands:

```
cd /dev
for part in mtd[0123] ; do
  dd if=$part of=/tmp/$part
done
```

4. Then, copy the resulting **mtdx** files found in the `/tmp` folder on the router to the computer using **scp** (make sure the size of the files is the same, when you copy them to the computer).
5. **Perform a powercycle** to reboot into the original non-ubi firmware (**to perform a powercycle**, unplug the device from the power source for about 30 seconds before plugging it back).
6. When the device is running **original/vendor firmware**, perform a factory reset.

Do not attempt to flash `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-initramfs-recovery-installer.itb` from the running **initramfs system** -- it will fail to reboot, possibly requiring serial console access. Instead, **powercycle** the device to reboot into the original non-ubi firmware, and then flash the `installer` version.

## Installing OpenWrt

#### Assuming the device is running stock firmware version 1.0, and is brand new or just after factory reset.

1. Connect any of the LAN ports of the device directly to the Ethernet port of your computer.
2. Set the IP address of your computer as `192.168.1.254` with netmask `255.255.255.0`, no gateway, no DNS.
3. Power on the device, wait about a minute for it to be ready.
4. Open a web browser, navigate to http://192.168.1.1 and wait for the wizard to come up.
5. Click *exactly* inside the radio button to confirm the terms and conditions, then abort the wizard.
6. You should then be greeted by the login screen, the stock password is "admin".
7. Navigate to __Administration__ -> __Firmware Upgrade__.
8. Upload `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-initramfs-recovery-installer.itb`.
9. Wait for a minute, the OpenWrt recovery image should come up.
9. Navigate to __System__ -> __Backup / Flash Firmware__.
10. Upload `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-squashfs-sysupgrade.itb`.
12. The device will reboot, you may proceed to setup OpenWrt.

## Upgrading to the latest OpenWrt snapshot 

**WARNING**
SNAPSHOTS ARE LARGELY UNTESTED!
PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!

1. Backup the original/vendor bootchain

   Connect to the device via SSH and enter the following commands:

   ```
   mkdir /tmp/boot_backup
   mount -t ubifs ubi0:boot_backup /tmp/boot_backup
   ```

   Then, copy the files under `/tmp/boot_backup` using *scp* to your computer. These files are needed in case you want to restore the original/vendor firmware. They can also be used in emergency case for reflashing via [JTAG](https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/e8450#jtag).

2. Both `auc` (attended sysupgrade command-line client) and `luci-app-attendedsysupgrade` (LuCI web-interface counterpart) are included since version 0.6. Simply run `auc` from the command-line, or navigate to __System__ -> __Attended Sysupgrade__ and proceed accordingly.

## To enter recovery mode under OpenWrt

1. Hold down the "reset" button (below the "WPS" button) whilst powering on the device.
2. Release the button once the power LED turns into orange/yellow.

This will remove any user configuration and allow restoring or upgrading from [ssh](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/installation/sysupgrade.cli)/http/[tftp](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/installation/generic.flashing.tftp).


## Restoring the vendor/official firmware ##

1. Boot into recovery mode, either by flashing `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-initramfs-recovery.itb` (note that this file doesn't have the word _installer_ in its filename) *or* by holding the RESET button while connecting the device to power *or* by issuing `echo c > /proc/sysrq-trigger` while running the production firmware. 
2. Use *scp* to copy the *mtdx* files to the `/tmp` folder on the router ([the backup that you have on your computer](#device-flash-backup-procedure-while-running-the-stock-firmware-version-10)), which is the **original/vendor bootchain and firmware** (the size of the *mtd3* file has to be **125MB** and make sure the size of the other files is the same, when you copy them to the router).
3. Connect to the device via SSH and enter the following commands:

```
ubidetach -d 0
insmod mtd-rw i_want_a_brick=1
mtd write /tmp/mtd0 /dev/mtd0
mtd write /tmp/mtd1 /dev/mtd1
mtd write /tmp/mtd2 /dev/mtd2
mtd write /tmp/mtd3 /dev/mtd3
```

4. Reboot the device and wait about a minute for it to be ready.
5. **Perform a powercycle** to reboot into the original non-ubi firmware (**to perform a powercycle**, unplug the device from the power source for about 30 seconds before plugging it back).
6. When the device is running **original/vendor firmware**, [flash the original/vendor firmware](#downgrade-firmware) and then perform a factory reset.

**Note:** In case you don't have a **complete backup** of the router (*mtd3* file size is not **125MB**), ask someone to share their *mtd3* file with you or **use the normal backup that you have** and then use TFTP to flash the vendor firmware according to [this procedure](https://www.linksys.com/us/support-article?articleNum=137928). (Not tested)
