This script downloads the OpenWrt ImageBuilder to generate a release-like (i.e. LuCI included) *sysupgrade* image. The process involves re-packaging the *initramfs* image to contain everything necessary for a permanent recovery image within the NAND flash, including the installer script and the prerequisite installation images.

The resulting file `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-initramfs-recovery-installer.itb` can be flashed via the vendor/official firmware web interface, as well as OpenWrt firmware running non-UBI builds (by running `sysupgrade -F openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-initramfs-recovery-installer.itb`).

**WARNING #1** This will replace the bootloader (TF-A 2.4, U-Boot 2021.10) and convert the flash layout of the device to [UBI](https://github.com/dangowrt/linksys-e8450-openwrt-installer/issues/9). The installer stores a copy of the previous bootchain in a dedicated UBI volume `boot_backup`.

**WARNING #2** Re-flashing the installer when the device is already using UBI flash layout will erase the previously backed up bootchain, which in most cases would be the vendor/official one.

For utmost safety (but not absolutely necessary), you are recommended to make a complete backup of the device flash __**before**__ running the installer. (see below "Device flash backup procedure while running the stock firmware or non-UBI OpenWrt build")

You'll need the below to use the script to generate the installer image:
* All [prerequisites of the OpenWrt ImageBuilder](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/additional-software/imagebuilder#prerequisites) 
* `libfdt-dev`
* `cmake`

If you are not interested in building yourself, the pre-built files are available [here](https://github.com/dangowrt/linksys-e8450-openwrt-installer/releases).

## Installing OpenWrt
#### Assuming the device is running stock firmware, and is brand new or just after factory reset.

1. Connect any of the LAN ports of the device directly to the Ethernet port of your computer.
2. Set the IP address of your computer as `192.168.1.254` with netmask `255.255.255.0`, no gateway, no DNS.
3. Power on the device, wait about a minute for it to be ready.
4. Open a web browser, navigate to http://192.168.1.1 and wait for the wizard to come up.
5. Click *exactly* inside the radio button to confirm the terms and conditions, then abort the wizard.
6. You should then be greeted by the login screen, the stock password is "admin".
7. Navigate to __Administration__ -> __Firmware Upgrade__.
8. Upload `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-initramfs-recovery-installer.itb`.
9. Wait for a minute, the OpenWrt recovery image should come up.
9. Navigate to __System__ -> __Backup / Flash Firmware__.
10. Upload `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-squashfs-sysupgrade.itb`.
12. The device will reboot, you may proceed to setup OpenWrt.

## Upgrading to the latest OpenWrt snapshot 

**WARNING**
SNAPSHOTS ARE LARGELY UNTESTED!
PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!

1. Backup the original/vendor bootchain

   Connect to the device via SSH and enter the following commands:

   ```
   mkdir /tmp/boot_backup
   mount -t ubifs ubi0:boot_backup /tmp/boot_backup
   ```

   Then, copy the files under */tmp/boot_backup* using *scp* to your host. These files are needed in case you want to restore the original/vendor firmware. They can also be used in emergency case for reflashing via [JTAG](https://openwrt.org/toh/linksys/e8450#jtag).

2. Both `auc` (attended sysupgrade command-line client) and `luci-app-attendedsysupgrade` (LuCI web-interface counterpart) are included since version 0.6. Simply run `auc` from the command-line, or navigate to __System__ -> __Attended Sysupgrade__ and proceed accordingly.

## To enter recovery mode under OpenWrt

1. Hold down the "reset" button (below the "WPS" button) whilst powering on the device.
2. Release the button once the power LED turns into orange/yellow.

This will remove any user configuration and allow restoring or upgrading from [ssh](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/installation/sysupgrade.cli)/http/[tftp](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/installation/generic.flashing.tftp).

## Device flash backup procedure while running the stock firmware or non-UBI OpenWrt build

1. Flash `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-initramfs-recovery.itb` (note that this file doesn't have the word _installer_ in it's filename)
2. Login and navigate to __System__, save a copy of each of the `mtdblock`.
3. In case of failure (because of ECC/OOB interoperability problems between the old and new SPI-NAND driver), connect to the device via SSH and enter the following commands:

```
cd /dev
for part in mtd[0123] ; do
  dd if=$part of=/tmp/$part
done
```

Then, copy the resulting files using *scp* to your host.

After this, do not attempt to flash `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-initramfs-recovery-installer.itb` from the running initramfs system -- it will fail to reboot, possibly requiring serial console access. Instead, power cycle the device to reboot into the original non-ubi firmware, and then flash the `installer` version.

## Restoring the vendor/official firmware ##

**If you have used v0.6.1 or later of installer, skip step #1 and just boot into on-flash recovery/initramfs instead.**

1. Flash `openwrt-mediatek-mt7622-linksys_e8450-ubi-initramfs-recovery.itb` (note that this file doesn't have the word _installer_ in it's filename)
2. Use *scp* to copy the original/vendor bootchain (*mtdx* files) to the device's */tmp* folder
2. Connect to the device via SSH and enter the following commands:

```
ubidetach -d 0
insmod mtd-rw i_want_a_brick=1
mtd write /tmp/mtd0 /dev/mtd0
mtd write /tmp/mtd1 /dev/mtd1
mtd write /tmp/mtd2 /dev/mtd2
mtd write /tmp/mtd3 /dev/mtd3
```

3. Reboot the device, use TFTP to flash the vendor firmware according to [this procedure](https://www.linksys.com/us/support-article?articleNum=137928).
